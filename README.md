# INFECTED GAMEMODE
TRAILER: https://youtu.be/OQMfn2CncM0
## RULEZ
Infected is a very popular gamemode seen in popular first person shooters such as CALL OF DUTY or HALO (Under the name "Infection"). It plays out with one person spawning in as infected, without any guns or ammo, who has to infect the rest of the lobby. The rest of the lobby doesn't know who is infected until the infected takes their first victim with melee. After that, its all out mayhem. The non-infected have to survive a specific amount of time set by the host, outlasting the hoard and winning the round. If they fail to do so, and everyone becomes infected, the infected win. The infected have some abilities, such as increased speed and health, giving them the ability to chase down anyone they desire. This gamemode is better played on a DM map, or a map with weapons scattered about, as the non-infected have ammo and are meant to shoot the infected to survive.
## INFORMATION
This is a gamemode for [Bonelab Fusion](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/Lakatrazz/Fusion/). This mod REQUIRES you have it installed, and is centered around it. You can only play this gamemode in bonelab fusion lobbies. To find this gamemode, go to bonemenu, click on Bonelab Fusion > Gamemodes > Infected, and you'll see "Infected". Click on that as the host, and start the gamemode with the "Start" button.
## FUTURE STUFFS
I am planning on adding cool stuff down the line. I am planning on awarding bits when you win games, more music and better Infected effects like an outline or sort of vignette. I am also planning on adding some sort of indication as to what role you are after the popup, because its somewhat easy to miss if the gamemode starts unexpectedly.
